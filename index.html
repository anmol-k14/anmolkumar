          The begining of college life comes with immense expectation
          and anticipation and here are some bulles about it which we
          would like to break.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Before Starting College, Life There Seems To Be Revolving Around
              Nothing But Friends, Party Invitations, Late Night Parties,
              Staying Out For As Long As You Like Without A Care In The World.
              We All Imagine Ourselves As Nothing Less Than The Alia Bhatt And
              Varun Dhawan In The 'Student Of The Year,' Do We?

              If You Are One Of The Popular Kids In High School You'll Hold The
              Hopes Of Being The College Superstar Too. And Why Shouldn't You
              After All, You Have Got All The Qualities Good At Academics, Great
              At Sports, The School's Poster Student

            <li>
              The Only Parties That You'll Go To, Will Be The After- Hours
              Hostel Parties Wherein You'd Sneak In Your Friend's Room And
              Celebrate With Hushed Voices Fearing The Wrath Of The Warden If
              Caught. And As Far As The Invitations Are Concerned The Only
              Invites That You'll Get Are From Your Textbooks And Classroom
              Notes To Memorize Them, That's Unless You Want To Fail Or Be Held
              Back That Semester.

              But The Reality Check In College Might Come As Quite A Hard Blow
              For You. You See, In College, There Are Students From Across The
              Country. All Of Whom Are Mostly As Talented As You And Some Even
              More. If You Want To Become The College Superstar You Might Have
              To Put In Quite A Lot More Of Hard Work As Compared To What You
              Did Back In School.
